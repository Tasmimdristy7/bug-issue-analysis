# Project Overview

In this project, I analyzed a JIRA issues dataset to gain insights into issue types and resolution times. Hereâ€™s a summary of what I did and what I achieved:

## Steps and Achievements

### 1. Import Libraries
- **What**: Imported `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn`.
- **Why**: For data manipulation and visualization.

### 2. Load Dataset
- **What**: Loaded the dataset, viewed basic info, summary stats, data types, and checked for missing values.
- **Why**: To understand the dataset structure and quality.

### 3. Visualize Issue Types
- **What**: Created a count plot of issue types.
- **Why**: To see the frequency of each issue type.

### 4. Convert Date Columns
- **What**: Converted 'created' and 'resolved' columns to datetime format.
- **Why**: To enable calculation of resolution times.

### 5. Calculate Resolution Time
- **What**: Calculated the resolution time for each issue by subtracting 'created' from 'resolved'.
- **Why**: To analyze how long it takes to resolve different types of issues.

### 6. Visualize Resolution Time by Issue Type
- **What**: Created a boxplot to show the distribution of resolution times for each issue type.
- **Why**: To identify patterns and outliers in resolution times across different issue types.

### 7. Additional Analysis
- **What**: 
  - Analyzed the distribution of resolution times using a histogram and KDE plot.
  - Examined correlations between numerical features with a heatmap.
  - Visualized relationships between features with a pairplot.
- **Why**: To gain deeper insights into the data and identify significant correlations or patterns among numerical features.

## Achievements
- **Data Composition**: Understood the composition of issue types in the dataset.
- **Date Conversion**: Successfully converted date fields and calculated resolution times.
- **Pattern Identification**: Identified patterns and correlations in the data, such as common issue types and resolution time distributions.
- **Effective Visualization**: Created clear and informative visualizations to communicate findings effectively.

## Why This Matters
- **Data Quality and Integrity**: Ensuring the dataset is clean and properly formatted is crucial for accurate analysis.
- **Operational Insights**: Understanding issue types and resolution times helps in improving project management and resource allocation.
- **Data-Driven Decisions**: Visual insights can drive informed decisions in handling issues efficiently.
